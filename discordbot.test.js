  Challenges in testing Discord bot event handlers:
  1.  **Client Instantiation and State**: Handlers often rely on the Discord `client` instance, its state (like cache), and methods (`client.channels.cache.get(...).send(...)`). Mocking this accurately can be complex.
  2.  **Asynchronous Operations**: Event handlers are almost always `async` and involve multiple asynchronous calls (API requests, other services). Managing these promises and mocks is crucial.
  3.  **Event Emission**: To test a handler, you need to simulate the event (e.g., `messageCreate`). This might involve using `client.emit('messageCreate', mockMsg)` if you have access to the client instance used by the bot.
  4.  **External Dependencies**: Bots interact with external services (Ollama, Stable Diffusion, Discord API itself). These need to be thoroughly mocked.
  5.  **Configuration**: Bots rely on environment variables or config files. These need to be mocked or provided during tests.
  6.  **Refactoring for Testability**: Sometimes, bot code needs to be refactored to make handlers more testable (e.g., extracting logic into pure functions that can be tested in isolation).

/*
Conceptual Outline for Testing `messageCreate` in `discordbot.js`:

1.  **Setup and Mocking (Primary Challenge)**:
    *   **`discord.js` Client**: The `messageCreate` event is tied to a `Client` instance. Testing this usually involves:
        *   Creating a mock `Client`.
        *   Attaching a spy or the actual `messageCreate` handler to this mock client's `on` method.
        *   Emitting a `messageCreate` event on the mock client with a mock `msg` object: `mockClient.emit('messageCreate', mockMsg)`.
        *   Alternatively, if `discordbot.js` can be refactored to export the `messageCreate` handler function directly, it can be called with `mockMsg`.
    *   **`msg` Object**: This is the core input. It needs to be carefully mocked for each test case:
        *   `msg.author`: To simulate user or bot messages.
        *   `msg.content`: The text content.
        *   `msg.attachments`: A `Map` of `MessageAttachment` objects. Each attachment needs:
            *   `url`: String URL for the image.
            *   `contentType`: String like 'image/png', 'image/jpeg', 'application/pdf'.
            *   `name`: String filename.
        *   `msg.reply()`: Often a `jest.fn()` to check if the bot replies.
        *   `msg.channel.send()` or `client.channels.cache.get().send()`: These are harder and require deeper client mocking.
    *   **`node-fetch` (global.fetch)**:
        *   Mock `global.fetch` using `jest.fn()`.
        *   For image downloads, make it return a Promise that resolves to a mock response:
            *   `ok: true`
            *   `buffer: jest.fn().mockResolvedValue(Buffer.from('mock image data'))` (for `node-fetch@2`)
            *   `arrayBuffer: jest.fn().mockResolvedValue(new ArrayBuffer(...))` (for native fetch or `node-fetch@3`, then use `Buffer.from()`)
        *   For failed downloads, `ok: false`.
    *   **`ollamaClient.js` (`getOllamaResponse`)**:
        *   `jest.mock('./ollamaClient.js', ...)`
        *   Mock `getOllamaResponse` to be a `jest.fn()`. This allows checking if it's called and with what arguments (especially `imageDatas`).
        *   It can resolve with a mock Ollama response: `{ response: '...', context: [...] }`.
    *   **`stableDiffusionClient.js` (`generateImage`)**:
        *   Similar mocking if testing parts of the flow that involve image generation.
    *   **Environment Variables**: Ensure `process.env` variables used by the bot (e.g., `SYSTEM_PROMPT`) are set or mocked.

2.  **Test Cases Outline**:

    *   **Message with no attachments**:
        *   Setup: `mockMsg.attachments` is empty or `size` is 0.
        *   Action: Trigger `messageCreate` with `mockMsg`.
        *   Verify:
            *   `fetch` is NOT called.
            *   `getOllamaResponse` is called.
            *   The `images` argument passed to `getOllamaResponse` is an empty array or undefined.

    *   **Message with a non-image attachment**:
        *   Setup: `mockMsg.attachments` contains an attachment with `contentType: 'application/pdf'`.
        *   Action: Trigger `messageCreate`.
        *   Verify:
            *   `fetch` is NOT called for this attachment.
            *   `getOllamaResponse` is called, and `images` argument is empty or undefined.

    *   **Message with one image attachment**:
        *   Setup:
            *   `mockMsg.attachments` contains one attachment with `contentType: 'image/png'` and a mock `url`.
            *   `fetch` is mocked to return a successful response with mock image buffer for that URL.
        *   Action: Trigger `messageCreate`.
        *   Verify:
            *   `fetch` IS called with the image `url`.
            *   `getOllamaResponse` IS called.
            *   The `images` argument passed to `getOllamaResponse` is an array containing one base64 string (derived from the mock image buffer).

    *   **Message with multiple image attachments**:
        *   Setup: Similar to one image, but `mockMsg.attachments` has multiple image attachments. `fetch` is mocked for all their URLs.
        *   Action: Trigger `messageCreate`.
        *   Verify:
            *   `fetch` is called for each image URL.
            *   `getOllamaResponse` is called, and `images` argument contains multiple base64 strings.

    *   **Failed image download**:
        *   Setup: `mockMsg.attachments` has an image. `fetch` is mocked to return `ok: false` or reject.
        *   Action: Trigger `messageCreate`.
        *   Verify:
            *   `fetch` is called.
            *   `console.error` is called with an error message (if implemented in bot).
            *   `getOllamaResponse` is called, and `images` argument is empty (or the bot handles the error in another way, e.g., replies with an error).
            *   `msg.reply` might be called with an error.
